            Programming procedural graphics have always been my fascination, especially when I get a glimpse of how such a complicated graphics pipeline interacts with other parts of systems flawlessly to produce a single pixel on your screen. I have played the trumpet and still really loved it. I also have done a few programming projects spanning multiple months, one of them being a simple Minecraft clone. I started programming in 3rd grade in which throughout my years programming, I have always wondered how to expose interesting, unique, and niche Computer Science topics hidden behind the curtain of endless programming tutorials to everyone.

            I'm a high schooler with a large variety of interests from baking, gardening, making spreadsheets, to coding. I enjoy learning about new topics and then spreading this knowledge to other people, especially when it's something I'm passionate about. Besides acting as the Treasurer for Coder's Cafe, I also participate in a few other clubs and organizations, and play the piano.

            Hello hello!! I'm just drifting oolong, seeing where life takes me—and I seem to have found myself as part of the Coder's Cafe. I hope that you all have fun in your own journeys through the world of computer science. After all, I love seeing everyone pursue what they want to pursue—from a mere subject that has caught their eye to their greatest passions. For me, those include graphic design, chemistry, and desserts! Computer science is an interest of mine that I hope will grow more with time and care, as all interests do.
